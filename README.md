## What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Matplotlibâ€™s primary purpose is to provide users with the tools and functionality to represent data graphically, making it easier to analyze and understand. It was originally developed by John D. Hunter in 2003 and is now maintained by a large community of developers.
## Installation of Matplotlib
If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.

Install it using this command:

    C:\Users\Your Name>pip install matplotlib

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed,  like Anaconda, Spyder etc.
### Import Matplotlib
Once Matplotlib is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import module statement:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Now Matplotlib is imported and ready to use
